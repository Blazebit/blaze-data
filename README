BlazeData
=========
Data processing utilities for Java SE and EE 6.

What is it?
===========

BlazeData is a framework for data processing, especially made to support data import and export
from and to files, databases etc. via various APIs. Currently we support a JPA Datastore which
should be compatible with all JPA implementations.
You can declare data in various formats and let the framework resolve dependencies you declared
and write the resolved data into a datastore. Currently we only support import, but export will be
added soon.

How to use it?
